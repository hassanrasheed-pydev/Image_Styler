🖼️ Image Styler with KNN

A simple yet powerful image stylization web app built with FastAPI and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for color quantization.
Upload any image — and watch it transform into multiple artistic versions with reduced color palettes, offering a “stylized” look.

🚀 Features

Lightweight & Fast — powered by FastAPI and optimized KNN clustering.

Smart Styling — generates multiple stylized versions automatically (2–12 color groups).

Interactive Slider — preview all styles smoothly without clutter.

Modern Dark UI — elegant, user-friendly interface refined using Claude 4.5 Sonnet for UI enhancement.

Fully Modular — core logic isolated in styler.py, server handled by server.py.
